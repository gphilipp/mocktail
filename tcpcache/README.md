#tcpcache

tcpcache is a fork on http://ws.apache.org/commons/tcpmon/ and can be used to cache/save tcp response.

From the original tcpmon source, GUI part is stripped. "tcpcache" is useful in following scenarios: 

## Caching
SOAP or TCP response can be cached. In that case configuration (mocktailconfig.properties) need to have
"chachingOn" property as "true".

## Printing SOAP response
If you don't want caching ON, you can switch that off using configuration. In that case, 
it works as tcpmon without GUI which is useful if you want to put a proxy in between 
your tcp source and target. This is useful to print SOAP responses.

## Sample mocktailconfig.properties

	## by default caching is ON. In this case the library works as stripped down version of tcpmon
	## which could be used in test cases or java classes as proxy to print the tcp responses.
	## In order to switch caching OFF, change cachingOn to false
	cachingOn=true

	## directory where cached recording will be stored. default is taken as sec/test/resources
	recordingDir=src/test/resources
	
## Sample usage of tcpcache in CXF based web service client.

	SimpleService_Service ss = new SimpleService_Service(wsdlURL,
		SERVICE_NAME);
	SimpleService port = ss.getP1();

	// for tcpcache to work -- start
	TcpCache tcpCache = new TcpCache(1234, "127.0.0.1", 8080,
		SimpleService_Service.class, "main", MocktailMode.RECORDING_NEW);
	BindingProvider bp = (BindingProvider) port;
	Map<String, Object> context = bp.getRequestContext();
	context.put(BindingProvider.ENDPOINT_ADDRESS_PROPERTY,
		"http://localhost:1234/ws/p1");
	// for tcpcache to work -- end

	{
	    System.out.println("Invoking concat...");
	    ConcatRequest _concat_parameters = new ConcatRequest();
	    _concat_parameters.setS1("First Value");
	    _concat_parameters.setS2("Second Value");
	    java.lang.String _concat__return = port.concat(_concat_parameters);
	    System.out.println("concat.result=" + _concat__return);
	}
	
## Sample usage of tcpcache in Axis2 based web service client
	
	//SimpleServiceStub service = new SimpleServiceStub("http://localhost:8080/axis2/services/SimpleService");
		
	//for tcpcache to work - start
	TcpCache tcpCache = new TcpCache(1234, "127.0.0.1", 8080, SimpleClient.class , "main", MocktailMode.RECORDING_NEW);
	SimpleServiceStub service = new SimpleServiceStub("http://localhost:1234/axis2/services/SimpleService");
	//for tcpcache to work - end
		
	ConcatRequest request = new ConcatRequest();
	request.setS1("abc");
	request.setS2("123");
	ConcatResponse response = service.concat(request);
	System.out.println(response.getConcatResponse());
